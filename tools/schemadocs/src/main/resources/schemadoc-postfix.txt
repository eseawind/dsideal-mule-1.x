  <xsd:element name="spring:property">
    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>
        A Spring property definition.
        This allows an arbitrary value to be set on the parent object being created.
        Typically this is used only when configuring custom classes which do not have
         a specific schema.
        See Spring documentation for further details (the "bean" on which this value is
        set should be clear from the context - it is typically a filter, transformer, etc).
